# CS-370-Module-Eight-README

Brief Explanation of the Project:
In this project, I worked on creating an intelligent agent to navigate a maze and find the treasure using reinforcement learning and neural networks.

Given Code: I was provided with a basic framework for the maze, some utility functions, and a few incomplete functions for implementing the Q-learning algorithm.

Self-Created Code: My main contributions included:

Implementing the core Q-training algorithm, where I filled in the pseudocode section to create episodes, decide actions (either through exploration or exploitation), and train the model using experience replay.
Enhancing the neural network model to improve the learning process and achieve better results in terms of maze navigation.
Connection to the Larger Field of Computer Science:
1. Role of Computer Scientists:
Computer scientists solve complex problems using computational approaches. They use algorithms, data structures, and various techniques like machine learning and artificial intelligence to make sense of data, automate tasks, and create efficient solutions. The essence of computer science is not just about coding but about leveraging computational power to create effective solutions to real-world problems.

2. Problem-Solving Approach:
As a computer scientist:

I first analyze the problem to understand its nature and requirements.
I break down the problem into smaller, manageable components.
I design algorithms or leverage existing methodologies to tackle each component.
I continuously test and refine my solutions to ensure they're effective and efficient.
In this course, I employed the above approach to tackle the pirate intelligent agent challenge, where understanding the problem was key before jumping into coding.

3. Ethical Responsibilities:
Being in the realm of computer science comes with ethical responsibilities. As a computer scientist, I believe:

To the End User: I owe transparency, privacy, and a commitment that my solutions won't harm or deceive. For instance, when creating AI models, it's crucial to ensure that they are unbiased and fair.
To the Organization: I owe diligence, honesty, and a commitment to provide efficient solutions without compromising integrity or security.
In this project, the responsibility was to ensure that the intelligent agent truly learned to navigate the maze without any hardcoded solutions or unethical shortcuts.

The learnings from this course, combined with my efforts in the pirate intelligent agent project, have fortified my understanding of reinforcement learning and neural networks. As I move forward, I'll leverage these skills to tackle more advanced problems in the realm of AI and computer science.
